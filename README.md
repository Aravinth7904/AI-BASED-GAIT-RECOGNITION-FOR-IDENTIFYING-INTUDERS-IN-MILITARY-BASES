# AI-BASED-GAIT-RECOGNITION-FOR-IDENTIFYING-INTUDERS-IN-MILITARY-BASES
Gait recognition is the systematic study of any human being or animal by extracting reliable gait features. Gait data is acquired and analyzed by using image processing and machine learning techniques. The proposed methodology is to identify the illegal intruders in military base by using machine learning techniques. The image is capture by using CCTV cameras from which the features are extracted and classified. The extracted features are analyzed in the machine – learning – neural networks pattern recognition. The features of military people in the base are extracted and saved in the database. The intruders with different gait features entering the military base is been detected by comparing the gait data base of military people. The Neural Network pattern recognition identifies the intruders with good percentage of accuracy. It is used to clearly classify the gait database and newly entering intruders in military bases.
